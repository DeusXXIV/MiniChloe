Decision has been made to change priority focus.
    A rudementary UI will be established before CRUD functionalities.
        This rudementary UI will not be the final and will be the bare minimum resemblance of a website.
            CRUD will be established after the initial rudementary UI is established.
                After CRUD Functions, interactability/Javascript will be applied, unless needed earlier.
