This is the same project as my "Chloe Project" repository, but will be downscoped severely in order to create a working prototype that is functional. 
The Chloe project is a personal passion project of mine, aimed to solve a project that I personally find annoying. 
This aims to solve the lack of media tracking that focuses on bookmarking events/chapters/episodes that contain something the user enjoys, as most are
media rating, ranking, and social sites.

Chloe project will initially not include a dataset for the media, but will instead be fulfilled by the user.
